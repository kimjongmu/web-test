    <p><strong><i><u>10 months in prison for husband, 10 months in prison for wife, 2 years probation</u></i></strong>

        His wife, B, in her 40s, who was charged with the same, was sentenced to 10 months in prison and two years probation. 
        Both A and B were ordered to pay 4.68 million won each.
        These couples are accused of arranging prostitution from October 2018 to June 17, 2020 at a business in Songpa-gu, Seoul, 
        with five massage rooms and receiving payments of 90,000 to 170,000 won.
         </p>
         Regarding this, the judge said, "These couples are not guilty of hiring a foreign woman who does not have a residence permit for employment activities in the process of arranging prostitution."
         "Both Mr. A and Mr. B have a history of being sentenced to imprisonment and fines in the past for the same crime, respectively, but they committed the same crime again."
