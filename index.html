    I have several friends I want to talk about, but today I will describe one of them. </p>

    <p><strong><i><u>have been friends since we were young. Even when we went to different schools,</u></i></strong>

    we kept in touch with each other. When we served military duty in different places, 
    we still talked to each other and helped each other to overcome the difficulties. </p>
    For me best friends mean being there when they need me, because it sounds easy, 
    but whenever they need me, being able to support them is not always easy. I think only best friends can do this.
     I do not know how long we will stay good friends, but I would like to as long as we live.
